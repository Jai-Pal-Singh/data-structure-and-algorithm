1.In the program count_sort, when I was trying to free the dynamically allocated memory to the array b and c in the function count_sort(), I was getting error
*** Error in `./a.out': free(): invalid next size (fast): 0x09e94030 ***
Aborted (core dumped)

I am not able to find out the reason behind it. So, I have commented that line (line no. 57). Please tell me the reason behind that...
